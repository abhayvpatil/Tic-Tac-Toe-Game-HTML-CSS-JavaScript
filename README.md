# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-HTML-CSS-JavaScript
web-based Tic Tac Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to play alternately by marking "X" or "O" in a 3×3 grid. The first player to place three marks in a row—either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
